### :1234: Instructions to Preview (Android)

1. Head over to the Google Play Store and download the Expo Go app

   - Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent

2. Open the [Expo Go](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent 'Expo Go') app or simply go to the [Expo website](https://expo.io/ 'Expo') and follow the instructions to register for an Expo account

   - Note: _**You will need an account on Expo in order to view the app!**_

3. After completing step 1 and 2 above, open your device camera and scan the provided QR code in the link below:

   - Link: https://expo.dev/@torjmen/deliveroo-clone (_**Published version of app hosted on Expo**_)

4. After scanning the QR code, the Expo Go app will automatically load up the app

   - Note: _**If this is your first time opening the app, it might take a while to load up. Please be patient!**_

5. Enjoy üòÄ

### :bangbang: IMPORTANT! - _Note for iOS users_

Unfortunately, iOS users will not be able to preview the published app hosted on Expo. This issue is due to restrictions imposed by Apple and not by Expo itself.

For this, please refer to the app screenshots below. A mixture of both screenshot pictures and GIFs is provided as an alternative for previewing the app.
